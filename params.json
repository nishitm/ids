The idea is to use an algorithm inspired by the eigenface\r\nalgorithm for face recognition. The details of the algorithm can be found in the paper\r\n\"Anomaly Detection Using Layered Networks Based on Eigen Co-Occurrence Matrix\" by\r\nOka, Oyama, Abe and Kato. The paper is attached with this project specification.\r\nThe idea behind the algorithm is to construct connected graphs of bash command flows for\r\neach user. If the flow becomes unusual, then we detect this as a malicious user. The\r\nalgorithm works in several stages. Over all sequences in the dataset, we perform Principal\r\nComponent Analysis (PCA) to come up with a new coordinate system represented by a set\r\nof eigen co-occurrence matrices. Co-occurrence matrix is analogous to the face in image\r\nanalysis while the eigen co-occurrence matrix is analogous to the eigenface. To find the\r\nfeatures associated with a sequence, the algorithm projects the co-occurrence matrix onto\r\nthe space defined by the Eigen co-occurrence matrices. In addition, the paper treats each\r\nprincipal component feature in order, calling each principal component feature “a layer”.\r\nDataset. We are attaching a dataset obtained from Stanford University as a zipped file.\r\nInside please find 50 users' command history. Dataset contains UserXX files that contain\r\n15,000 bash commands for User XX. The first 5000 entries in each file are training entries;\r\nthey are guaranteed to have been entered by User XX. The rest of the file is test data and is\r\ndivided into sections of 100 entries that either belong to user XX or to someone else.\r\nThe file reference.txt provides the key for the rest of the file. It is a 100 x 50 matrix. Each\r\ncolumn represents a User index and each row represents whether the segment of 100\r\ncommands has been entered by the user (labeled by 0) or by a masquerader (1). For\r\nexample, with our counting starting at 1, rather than 0, [row 2, col 3] = 0 means that the\r\ncommands 5100 - 5200 in file User3 have actually been entered by User 3.\r\n\r\n",
